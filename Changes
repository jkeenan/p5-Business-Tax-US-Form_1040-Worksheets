Revision history for Perl module Business::Tax::US::Form_1040::Worksheets

0.01 Fri Mar 24 05:25:07 2023
    - original version; created by ExtUtils::ModuleMaker 0.63
    - pushed to CPAN approx. Wed Feb 21 11:00 2024, but due to CPAN
      malfunctioning was not indexed and hence did not appear on metacpan or
      cpantesters

0.02 Fri Feb 23 08:57:32 AM EST 2024
    - Introduce pp_qdcgtw() for pretty-printing the qd-worksheet
    - Like 0.01, this version will probably not make it to CPAN, so I'm
      tagging it and pushing to GH

0.03 Fri Feb 23 03:49:44 PM EST 2024
    - Introduce social_security_worksheet_data().
    - Like preceding versions, this version will probably not make it to CPAN,
      so I'm tagging it and pushing to GH

0.04 Fri Feb 23 08:20:22 PM EST 2024
    - Introduce pp_ssbw() for pretty-printing the ssb-worksheet.
    - Like preceding versions, this version will probably not make it to CPAN,
      so I'm tagging it and pushing to GH

0.05 Fri Feb 23 09:49:50 PM EST 2024
    - In 0.04, pp_ssbw() wasn't doing any pretty-printing.  Corrected.
    - Like preceding versions, this version will probably not make it to CPAN,
      so I'm tagging it and pushing to GH
